The current state of fintech (financial technology) security, while well developed, still has significant vulnerabilities. We observe the current states of Venmo and Cash App, two ubiquitous fintech applications to analyze their functionalities across network traffic and logical data acquisition of a mobile phone. We present PyMent, a novel forensic framework that leverages Venmoâ€™s APIs to remotely log into accounts, bypass Multi-factor Authentication, and retrieve complete transaction histories. By implementing a Man-in-the-Middle attack scenario, we were able to intercept and parse Application Programming Interface (API) calls, user information, system functionality, sensitive cookies, and token values of both Venmo and Cash App. Our findings, developed through extensive research and online resources, aim to enhance responses to cybercrimes involving digital wallets and fintech payment applications. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the HTTP frameworks of Venmo and Cash App.


This paper presents PyMent which is a forensic framework designed to aid investigators in acquiring and analyzing transaction data from fintech applications like Venmo and Cash App. Using Api calls PyMent retrieves detailed user transaction histories, addressing a significant gap in digital forensics related to mobile payment platforms. Our contributions include a practical forensic tool, a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities in fintech APIs, and a case study demonstrating real-world applicability. This work aligns the DFRWS focus of advancing forensic methods in response to emerging technologies and cybercrime.
